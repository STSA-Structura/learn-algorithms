# Two Pointers Pattern

The **Two Pointers Pattern** is a powerful algorithmic technique that uses two variables (pointers) to traverse linear data structures like arrays, strings, or linked lists. By coordinating the movement of these pointers, this pattern enables efficient problem-solving, often improving time and space complexity.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Two Pointers

> 1. Two variables, often representing indices or positions, used to traverse a data structure.
> 1. Typically initialized at logical extremes, such as the beginning and end of an array.

### 2. Dynamic Movement

> 1. Pointers adjust their positions based on specific conditions, optimizing operations.

### 3. Efficiency

> 1. Reduces time complexity from \(O(n^2)\) to \(O(n)\) in many problems.
> 1. Frequently maintains \(O(1)\) space complexity.

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Palindrome Check

> 1. `Problem`: Determine if a string reads the same forward and backward.
> 1. `Approach`: Use two pointers starting at the beginning and end of the string, moving inward while comparing characters.
> 1. `Complexity`: \(O(n)\) time, \(O(1)\) space.

#### Example Code

```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    left, right = 0, len(s) - 1
    while left < right:
        if s[left] != s[right]:
            return False
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    return True
```

### 2. `Array Reversal`

- `Problem`: Reverse an array in place.
- `Approach`: Use two pointers at opposite ends of the array, swapping elements and moving inward.
- `Complexity`: \(O(n)\) time, \(O(1)\) space.

#### Example Code:

```python
def reverse_array(arr):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        arr[left], arr[right] = arr[right], arr[left]
        left += 1
        right -= 1
```

### 3. `Pair Sum in a Sorted Array`

- `Problem`: Find two numbers in a sorted array that add up to a target value.
- `Approach`: Use two pointers, one starting at the beginning and the other at the end, adjusting their positions based on the sum relative to the target.
- `Complexity`: \(O(n)\) time, \(O(1)\) space.

#### Example Code:

```python
def pair_sum(nums, target):
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    while left < right:
        current_sum = nums[left] + nums[right]
        if current_sum == target:
            return (nums[left], nums[right])
        elif current_sum < target:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
    return None
```

### 4. `Removing Duplicates from a Sorted Array`

- `Problem`: Remove duplicates in place and return the new length of the array.
- `Approach`: Use a slow pointer to track unique elements and a fast pointer to traverse the array.
- `Complexity`: \(O(n)\) time, \(O(1)\) space.

#### Example Code:

```python
def remove_duplicates(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    i = 0
    for j in range(1, len(nums)):
        if nums[j] != nums[i]:
            i += 1
            nums[i] = nums[j]
    return i + 1
```

---

### 5. `Partitioning an Array`

- `Problem`: Partition an array around a pivot.
- `Approach`: Use two pointers to ensure elements smaller than the pivot are on the left and larger elements are on the right.
- `Complexity`: \(O(n)\) time, \(O(1)\) space.

#### Example Code:

```python
def partition_array(arr, pivot):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        if arr[left] <= pivot:
            left += 1
        elif arr[right] > pivot:
            right -= 1
        else:
            arr[left], arr[right] = arr[right], arr[left]
            left += 1
            right -= 1
    return arr
```

## Additional Use Cases

### 1. `Merging Two Sorted Arrays`

- Merge two sorted arrays into a single sorted array using two pointers, similar to the merge step in merge sort.

### 2. `Finding Intersection of Two Sorted Arrays`

- Traverse two sorted arrays simultaneously to identify common elements efficiently.

### 3. `Cycle Detection in Linked Lists`

- Detect cycles using two pointers moving at different speeds (Floydâ€™s Tortoise and Hare algorithm).

## Real-World Applications

### 1. **Memory Management**

- Manage free and used memory blocks using two pointers to mark boundaries during allocation or garbage collection.

### 2. **Network Packet Processing**

- Use two pointers to handle packet windows for efficient flow control in real-time network systems.

### 3. **Data Stream Processing**

- Apply a sliding window approach with two pointers to compute moving averages or frequency counts in streams.

### 4. **Text Parsing**

- Parse structured text formats like JSON or XML efficiently by coordinating two pointers to process character streams or delimiters.
